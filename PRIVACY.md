- **User Input Parameters**: Such as stock codes, date ranges, or other query parameters you provide.
- **API Responses**: The financial data returned by BurnCloud in response to your queries.

The Plugin does **not** persistently store any of this information. All data is processed in memory only for the duration of your request.
